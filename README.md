# Ancestors_trees
Run the python code to generate one inbreeding tree representation or a set of them using 
1) build_tree_conections_plot_loop_seed.py for the set
2) build_tree_conections_plot.py for one

In each case, remember to indicate properly the path of the ancestor's files with the tables (ancestors vs. generation)

3) 5 FILES WITH TABLES ARE PROVIDEN HERE.
